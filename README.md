# DevRant Bot
An NPM package to create DevRant bots,   
Super easy to implement,  
Never care about implementation again, just focus on functionality.

## How To Use
This package can be used to create bots which will act when someone mentions it.  
It can then Reply to that mention with some text or image.
```js
var Bot = require('devrant-bot');

(async function() {
var bot = new Bot();
await bot.login("username","password");
var mentions = await bot.get();
console.log(mentions);
})();
```
Which produces,

```js
[
  {
    "rid": 2821893, //rant ID
    "cid": 3308364,  //comment ID
    "is_bot": false, //User who has called is a bot or not
    "text": "some message", //Message
    "user": "theabbie",  //Username of user who called
    "time": 1603281044  //Timestamp of comment
    "rto": [{
       "id": 3307103,
       "text": "text",
       "time": 1603264598,
     },
     ...]
  },
  ...
]
```

To reply,

```js
(async function() {
var bot = new Bot();
await bot.login("username","password");
var mentions = await bot.get();
for (msg of mentions) {
  await bot.reply(msg.user,msg.rid,"reply", image_url);
}
})();
```

This makes bot development really easy and you can safely focus only on the functionality rather than the implementation of the DevRant bot.
