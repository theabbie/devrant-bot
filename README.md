An NPM package to create DevRant Bots,

## How To Use
This Package can be used to create Bots which will act when someone mentions it.  
It can then Reply to that mention with some text or image.
```js
var Bot = require('devrant-bot');

(async function() {
var bot = new Bot();
await bot.login("username","password");
var mentions = await bot.get();
console.log(mentions);
})();
```
Which Produces,

```js
[
  {
    "rid": 2821893, //rant ID
    "cid": 3308364,  //comment ID
    "text": "some message", //Message
    "user": "theabbie"  //Username of user who called
  },
  ...
]
```

To reply,

```js
(async function() {
var bot = new Bot();
await bot.login("username","password");
var mentions = await bot.get();
for (msg of mentions) {
  await bot.reply(msg.user,msg.rid,"reply"[,image_url]);
}
})();
```

This Makes Bot Development Really easy and you can safely focus only on the functionality rather than the implementation of the Bot.
